  <h1 id="me"> I Am Who I Am </h1>
  <p> As ya'll can tell my name is Ryann' Clark. I was born and raised in Hayward, California and I currently attend Hayward High School.
  I grew up in a single parent household, but personally it worked out for the best. My mother is my greatest role model and biggest supporter.
  Growing up in a single parent household wasn't always easy and we had our fair share of struggles, but now we are steady and everything is pretty good now.
  My only real father figure was my uncle and even though we had a great deal of disagreements, he was still the best male role model I had up until he passed away at the beginning of this year. </p>
  <p> I decided to join SMASH because I knew that college wasn't really the biggest option for me. Growing up I knew for a fact that I wasn't going to be able to afford college and that scholarships was my only option.
  When I was young my mother always told me that I needed a high paying job because California is so expensive. So magically I wanted to be some crazy high paying singer and I wanted to live in LA and had these crazy ideas of what life would be like.
  Once I reached the 7th grade I realized that I wanted to be a computer scientist. As time went on I slowly began to fall in and out of love with CS. Now I know that to succeed I have to stick with it because as long as I keep going I'll be able to get the hang of it. </p>
